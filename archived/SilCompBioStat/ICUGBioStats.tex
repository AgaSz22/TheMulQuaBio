% TO DO:

% *Complete and include LinMods.tex
% *Add sections on power tests in sampling design chapter
% *Add reminders for how to create new columns in data frames to hold transformed variables, for example. 
% *Fix example code for chapter 9 - model simplification steps are not  
% same as in the text. Especially, maximum model is being compared with alternative 
% models in segment of the code, but not in the main text.
% *Explain the difference between t and F tests better in the context of linear models, and in model simplification. 
% * That is, explain lm output in terms of ANOVA vs. parameter estimates table:

% Parameter Estimates:
% The column labeled Variable should be self-explanatory. It contains the names of the predictor variables which label each row of output.

% DF stands for degrees of freedom. For the moment, all entries will be 1.  Degrees of freedom will be discussed in detail later.

% The Parameter Estimates are the regression coefficients. The regression equation is

% LHCY = 1.570602 - 0.082103 LCLC - 0.136784 LB12
% To find the predicted homocysteine level of someone with a CLC of 12.3 and B12 of 300, we begin by taking logarithms. Log(12.3)=1.0899 and log(300)=2.4771. We then calculate
% LHCY = 1.570602 - 0.082103 1.0899 - 0.136784 2.4771
     % = 1.1423
% Homocysteine is the anti-logarithm of this value, that is, 101.1423 = 13.88.
% The Standard Errors are the standard errors of the regression coefficients. They can be used for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals. For example, confidence intervals for LCLC are constructed as (-0.082103 k 0.03381570), where k is the appropriate constant depending on the level of confidence desired. For example, for 95% confidence intervals based on large samples, k would be 1.96.

% The T statistic tests the hypothesis that a population regression coefficient is 0 WHEN THE OTHER PREDICTORS ARE IN THE MODEL. It is the ratio of the sample regression coefficient to its standard error. The statistic has the form (estimate - hypothesized value) / SE. Since the hypothesized value is 0, the statistic reduces to Estimate/SE. If, for some reason, we wished to test the hypothesis that the coefficient for LCLC was -0.100, we could calculate the statistic (-0.082103-(-0.10))/0.03381570.

% Prob > |T| labels the P values or the observed significance levels for the t statistics. The degrees of freedom used to calculate the P values is given by the Error DF from the ANOVA table. The P values tell us whether a variable has statistically significant predictive capability in the presence of the other variables, that is, whether it adds something to the equation. In some circumstances, a nonsignificant P value might be used to determine whether to remove a variable from a model without significantly reducing the model's predictive capability. For example, if one variable has a nonsignificant P value, we can say that it does not have predictive capability in the presence of the others,remove it, and refit the model without it. These P values should not be used to eliminate more than one variable at a time, however. A variable that does not have predictive capability in the presence of the other predictors may have predictive capability when some of those predictors are removed from the model.
