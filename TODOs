    * .gitignore will prevent untracked files from being added (without an add -f) to the set of files tracked by git, however git will continue to track any files that are already being tracked. To stop tracking a file you need to remove it from the index. This can be achieved with this command.#
    `git rm --cached <file>`
    
    The removal of the file from the head revision will happen on the next commit.
