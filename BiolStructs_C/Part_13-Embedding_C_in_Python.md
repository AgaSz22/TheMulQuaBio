# 13. Calling C code from Python

## General Introduction to Calling C From Other Languages
One of the conveniences of "lower-level" languages like C/C++ is that they are "easily" called from the environments of other languages.
As long as your C code has been pre-compiled for the architecture of the system calling it, it is possible to interface with that code from languages you're already familiar with, such as R or Python. 
Even easier is calling C code from C++ which just a few simple modifications to header files.

### Static vs. dynamic libraries
