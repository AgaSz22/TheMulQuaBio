    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "We have talked a lot about workflows and confronting models with data.\n",

    "\n",
    "The CMEE Miniproject gives you an opportunity to try the “whole nine\n",
    "yards” of developing and implementing a workflow and delivering a\n",
    "“finished product” — where you ask and answer a scientific question in\n",
    "biology (potentially involving multiple sub-questions/hypotheses).\n",
    "\n",
    "The miniproject will give you an opportunity to perform a “dry run” of\n",

    "\n",
    "<span>**The general question you will address is:**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "*What mathematical model best fits an empirical dataset?*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think of this as testing a set of alternative hypotheses —\n",
    "arguably every alternative hypothesis is nothing but an alternative\n",
    "model to describe an observed phenomenon (more on this in the Primer on\n",
    "Model Fitting Lectures delivered during the Miniproject week).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may choose any dataset and set of alternative models, provided that\n",
    "the work can feasibly be done in the time you have for your miniproject\n",
    "(see the CMEE Guidebook for the submission deadline). You may choose a\n",
    "problem and dataset that is a related to, or even preliminary work for\n",
    "your main Masters project (to give you a reality/feasibility) check.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span>*Please read the papers in the Readings and Resources section of\n",
    "this chapter*</span> — these will help you make a decision about what\n",

    "\n",
    "You will also be give lectures on model fitting in Ecology ad Evolution\n",
    "at the start of the Miniproject week.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Miniproject must satisfy the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It should employ all the biological computing tools you have learned\n",
    "    so far: shell (bash) scripting, git, LaTeX, R, and Python. Using\n",
    "    these tools, you will build a workflow that starts with the data and\n",
    "    ends with a written report (in LaTeX).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  <span>*At least*</span> two different models (hypotheses) must be\n",
    "    fitted to the data. The models should be fitted and selected using\n",
    "    an appropriate method (e.g., non-linear least squares for model\n",
    "    fitting and the Akaike Information Criterion for model selection,\n",
    "    respectively). You will be given a primer on model fitting before\n",
    "    you start on your Miniproject.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The project should be fully reproducible — a script should glue the\n",
    "    workflow together and run it. I should be able to run just this\n",
    "    script to get everything to work, from data processing to model\n",
    "    fitting to plotting (e.g., in <span>R</span>) to compilation of the\n",
    "    LaTeX written report. (<span>*More detailed instructions on this\n",

    "\n",
    "have an introduction with objectives of the study, and appropriate\n",
    "additional sections such as methods, data, results, discussion, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "At this stage, I am not going to tell you how to organize your project —\n",

    "\n",
    "### Marking criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "<span>*Equal weightage will be given to the code+workflow and writeup\n",
    "components — each component will be marked to a max of 100 pts and then\n",

    "\n",
    "I will be looking for the following while assessing your submission:\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-organized project where code, results, data, etc., are easy to\n",
    "locate, inspect, and use. In the project’s README also include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Any dependencies or special packages I should be aware of\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What each package you used is for\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Version of each language used\n",
    "\n",
    "A python or bash script called <span>run\\_MiniProject.py</span> or\n",
    "<span> run\\_MiniProject.sh</span> respectively, that runs the project\n",
    "\n",
    "A report that contains all the components indicated above in “The\n",
    "Report” subsection — I will be looking for some original thought and\n",
    "synthesis in the Intro and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality of the presentation of the graphics and tables in your report,\n",
    "as well as any plots showing model fits to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marking criteria you may refer to is the summative marking criteria\n",
    "given in Appendix \\[chap:Appendices\\] titled “MARKING CRITERIA for EXAMS\n",
    "and ESSAYS and COURSEWORK”.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Candidate Problem: Fitting TPCs\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "One choice you have is to use a large dataset that we can provide to\n",
    "address the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span>*How well do different mathematical models, based upon biochemical\n",
    "principles vs. phenomenological ones, fit to the thermal responses of\n",
    "metabolic traits (rates)?*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is currently a “hot” (no pun intended!) topic in biology, with both\n",
    "ecological and evolutionary consequences, as we discussed in the\n",
    "modelling lecture. On the <span>*ecological side*</span>, because the\n",
    "temperature-dependence of metabolic rate sets the rate of intrinsic\n",
    "$r_{max}$ (papers by Savage et al., Brown et al.) as well as\n",
    "interactions between species, it has a strong effect on population\n",
    "dynamics. In this context, note that 99.9% of life on earth is\n",
    "ectothermic! On the <span>*evolutionary side*</span>, the\n",
    "temperature-dependence of fitness and species interactions also means\n",
    "that warmer environments may have stronger rates of evolution. This may\n",
    "be compounded by the fact that mutation rates may also increase with\n",
    "temperature (papers by Gillooly et al.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called <span>BiotraiTPCdata.csv</span> and contains\n",
    "hundreds of “thermal responses” for growth, respiration and\n",
    "photosynthesis rates in plants and bacteria (both aquatic and\n",
    "terrestrial). These data were collected through lab experiments across\n",

    "### The Models\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple models that might best describe these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schoolfield model (paper is in <span>Readings</span> directory) is\n",

    "in your workflow (you can choose to do it differently!):\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python or R script that imports the data and prepares it for NLLS\n",
    "fitting, with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "It should create unique ids so that you can identify unique thermal\n",
    "responses (what does this mean?)\n",
    "\n",
    "It should filter out datasets with less than 5 data points (why?)\n",
    "\n",
    "It should deal with negative and zero trait values (why?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The script should add columns containing starting values of the model\n",
    "parameters for the NLLS fitting (how will you get these?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the modified data to a new csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script that opens the new modified dataset (from step 1) and\n",
    "does the NLLS fitting, with the following features:\n",

    "Uses <span>lmfit</span> — look up submodules <span>minimize</span>,\n",

    "lmfit example in class, you may want to look for others online.\n",

    "\n",
    "The more thermal response curves you are able to fit, the better — that\n",

    "\n",
    "Explore the two models – be able to plot them. Write them as functions\n",
