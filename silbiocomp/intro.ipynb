    "need to know to perform the exercises in it. In programming and\n",
    "computing, you learn faster by trying to solve problems (including\n",
    "computer crashes!) on your own, often by liberally googling the problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be provided guidelines for what makes good or efficient\n",

    "The goals of this course\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this course is to teach you to become (or at least show you\n",
    "the path towards becoming) a competent quantitative biologist. A large\n",
    "part of this involves learning computer programming. Why do biologists\n",
    "need to write write computer programs? Here are some (hopefully\n",
    "compelling to you!) reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Short of fieldwork, programs can do anything (that can\n",
    "    be specified). In fact, even fieldwork, if you could one day <span>\n",
    "    *program*</span> a robot to do it for you [^1]!\n",
    "\n",
    "-   As such, no software is typically available to perform exactly the\n",
    "    analysis you are planning. You should be unhappy if you are trying\n",
    "    to shoehorn your data into methods that don’t quite seem right.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Biological problems and datasets are some of the most\n",
    "    complicated imaginable. Programming permits success despite\n",
    "    complexity through precise specification and modularization of\n",
    "    complicated analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Modularity – programming allows you to break up your complex\n",
    "    analysis in smaller pieces, yet keep all the pieces in a single,\n",
    "    functional analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Reproducibility – you (or someone else) can just re-run the code to\n",
    "    reproduce your analysis. This is also the key to maintaining\n",
    "    scientific accountability, integrity, and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Organised thinking – writing code requires you to do this!\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Career prospects – good, scientific coders are in short supply in\n",
    "    all fields, but most definitely in biology!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several hundred programming languages currently available –\n",
    "which ones should a biologist choose? Ideally, a quantitative biologist\n",
    "would like to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A <span>*fast*</span>, compiled (or semi-compiled) ‘procedural’\n",
    "    language like <span>C</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  A modern, easy-to-write, interpreted (or semi-compiled) language\n",
    "    that is still quite fast, like <span>python</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  A mathematical/statistical software with programming and graphing\n",
    "    capabilities like <span>R</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "And all these because one language doesn’t fit all purposes. Therefore\n",
    "you will learn a few different languages in this course — hopefully,\n",
    "just the right number! Among the languages you will learn here — <span>\n",
    "python</span>, <span>R</span>, and <span>C</span> are three of the most\n",
    "popular currently (see <https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/> and\n",
    "[ https://goo.gl/vyrqr1]( https://goo.gl/vyrqr1), and for some very good\n",
    "reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to teach you not just programming, but also good computing\n",
    "practices. In this course, you will write plenty of code, deal with\n",
    "different data files, and produce text and graphic outputs. You will\n",
    "learn to keep your project and coursework organized in logical,\n",
    "efficient, error-free and reproducible <span>*workflows*</span> (that’s\n",
    "a mouthful, but an important mouthful).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some guidelines, conventions and rules\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beware the dark forces\n",
    "\n",
    "You will NOT be using spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel) in these\n",
    "classes. There are times when you will feel the pull of the dark side\n",
    "(ahem!), and imagine a more “comfortable” world where you are\n",
    "mouse-clicking your way happily though Excel-based data manipulations\n",
    "and analyses. NO! You will be doing yourself a disservice. On the\n",
    "long-ish run you will be much better off visualizing and manipulating\n",
    "data on your computer using a programming language like R. This is\n",
    "something you will learn, young <span>*padawan*</span>!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep your workflow organized\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following chapters, you will practice many examples where you are\n",
    "required to write large blocks of code. Please get into the habit of\n",
    "writing code into text files with an appropriate extension (e.g.,\n",
    "<span>.R</span> for <span>R</span> code, <span>.py</span> for\n",
    "<span>python</span> code, etc.). Furthermore, please keep all your code\n",
    "files organized in one or more directories (e.g., named\n",
    "<span>Code</span>!). Similarly, some of these scripts will take data\n",
    "files as inputs, and output some results in the form of text or\n",
    "graphics. Please keep these inputs and outputs organized as well, in\n",
    "separate directories (e.g., named <span>Data</span> and <span>\n",
    "Results</span>) respectively. Your demonstrators and I will help you get\n",
    "set up and abide by this “workflow”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conventions used in this document\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this document, directory paths will be specified in UNIX\n",
    "(Mac, Linux) style, using $/$ instead of the \\\\ used in Windows. Also,\n",
    "in general, we will be using <span>*relative paths*</span> throughout\n",
    "the exercises and practicals (more on this later, but google it!).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find all command line/console arguments, code snippets and\n",
    "output in coloured boxes like this:"

    "### To IDE or not to IDE?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you embark on your journey to becoming a competent prectioner of\n",
    "biological computing, you will be faced with a hamletian question: “To\n",
    "IDE or not to IDE”. OK, maybe not that dramatic or hamletian...\n",
    "\n",
    "An interactive Development Environment (IDE) is a text editor with\n",
    "frills that can make life easy by auto-formatting code, running code\n",
    "though the terminal or command line, allowing a graphic view of the\n",
    "workspace (your active functions, variables, etc.), graphic debugging\n",
    "and profiling (you will see these delightful things later), and allowing\n",
    "integrated version control (e.g., using <span>git</span>). You will\n",
    "benefit a lot of you use a code editor that can also offer an IDE (e.g.,\n",
    "emacs, vim, geany, atom). At the very least, your IDE should offer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic code wrapping (e.g., keeping lines $<$80 characters long)\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax highlighting (e.g., commands vs. variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "Code folding (fold large blocks of code, say an entire function or loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyboard control of commenting/uncommenting, code wrapping, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded terminal / shell / commandline console\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending commands to terminal / shell\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you end up using multiple programming languages, you will want an\n",
    "IDE that can handle them. For example, <span>RStudio</span> cannot\n",
    "handle more than a fixed set of 2-3 languages. I use <span>geany</span>,\n",
    "which has many plugins that make multi-language (multilingual?) code\n",
    "development much easier. I would also recommend <span>vim</span> or\n",
    "<span>emacs</span>, which have a steeper learning curve, but are very\n",
    "powerful once you have mastered them. There are also some new and\n",
    "(increasingly popular) kids on the block: <span>atom</span> and\n",
    "<span>vstudio code</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Undergraduates\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessment will be through a computer-based test. You be expected to be\n",
    "able to apply the concepts you have learnt to address questions by using\n",
    "appropriate R input and interpreting R output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Masters students\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assess both your practical computing work itself (including any\n",
    "writeups), and whether you are following good programming and workflow\n",
    "practices, on a weekly basis. This will be done using scripts — yes we\n",
    "will assess your scripts using scripts! A <span>python</span> script\n",
    "will check whether your weekly (and version-controlled) directories are\n",
    "neat and organized in a logical workflow, and whether all the scripts\n",
    "run correctly with the expected inputs and outputs, starting from Week 1\n",
    "(Chapter \\[chap:unix1\\]). Specifically, as an example towards learning\n",
    "good workflow practices, you will keep all your coursework code, data\n",
    "inputs and results outputs organized in separate directories named\n",
    "<span>Code</span>, <span>Data</span>, <span>Results</span> (or\n",
    "equivalent) respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment script will then record a log file that summarizes all\n",
    "the issues found in your workflows, which will be emailed to you by the\n",
    "middle of the week (usually on the wednesday) subsequent to the one you\n",
    "submitted your weekly practical work in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that practicals in the weeks/modules not in these notes (e.g., GIS,\n",
    "Genomics, Population Genetics) will also be included in the assessment.\n",
    "The basic rules you must follow, irrespective of a Week’s content are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  All code/scripts go to a <span>Code</span> directory\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  All data go to a <span>Data</span> directory\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  All results go to a <span>Results</span> directory, but the Results\n",
    "    directory should be empty when you submit your week’s work, as it\n",
    "    will be populated automatically when the assessment script runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  If you have files that don’t fit in these categories, put them\n",
    "    additional, meaningfully named directories (e.g,\n",
    "    “<span>Writeup</span>”).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  No single file should be greater than 100 mb, either data\n",
    "    or script/code. If a script needs a data file, but the example data\n",
    "    file is &gt;100 mb, reduce it to a minimum working dataset and\n",
    "    upload that, keeping the main data file(s) under\n",
    "    <span>.gitignore</span> (more on this soon!). Keep the main data\n",
    "    backed up of course [^2].\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Most importantly, all python, R, bash, and LaTeXscripts should run\n",
    "    OK, taking in data and spitting out the results as necessary (these\n",
    "    are the scripts the assessment code will try to run)\n",
    "\n",
    "When necessary, more specific, module-specific details on weekly\n",
    "coursework and assessment will be given when the module starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computing coursework marking criteria are given in the Appendix\n",
    "\\[chap:Appendices\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The final assessment of weekly coursework\n",
    "\n",
    "A written summary assessment of your overall performance with your marks\n",
    "will be sent after the end of the 9 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly assessments are to help you spot general, as well as\n",
    "programming language-specific issues with your computing coursework on a\n",
    "regular basis. You may and should fix bugs and other problems that\n",
    "feedback logs bring to your attention. I will have a look at how much\n",
    "you addressed the issues in the final assessment. The final assessment\n",
    "will be necessarily a more subjective than the weekly assessments as we\n",
    "are looking to give you an overall picture of how you did and what you\n",
    "can improve on. To give you an idea about the criteria for the overall\n",
    "assessment, a set of summative marking criteria are also given in\n",
    "Appendix \\[chap:Appendices\\] titled “MARKING CRITERIA for EXAMS and\n",
