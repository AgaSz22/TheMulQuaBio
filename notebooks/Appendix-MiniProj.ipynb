    "We have talked a lot about workflows and confronting models with data. It's time to do something concrete with all the techniques you have been learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMEE Miniproject gives you an opportunity to try the \"whole nine yards\" of developing and implementing a workflow and delivering a \"finished product\" — where you ask and answer a scientific question in biology (potentially involving multiple sub-questions/hypotheses). It will give you an opportunity to perform a \"dry run\" of executing your actual dissertation project, and you may use it to trial some of the techniques and/or explore some of the data/theory you might use in your Dissertation project.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**The general question you will address is:** *What mathematical model best fits an empirical dataset?*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think of this as testing a set of alternative hypotheses — every alternative hypothesis is nothing but an alternative model to describe an observed phenomenon, as you will have learned in the lectures on model fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Project \n",
    "\n",
    "You will choose a dataset and set of alternative models from the options provided to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please read the papers in the [Readings](#Readings) section* — these will help orient you in the right direction for tackling your miniproject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Miniproject must satisfy the following criteria (and follow the accompanying guidelines):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It should employ all the biological computing tools you have learned so far: shell (bash) scripting, git, LaTeX, R, and Python. Using these tools, you will build a workflow that starts with the data and ends with a written report (in LaTeX). How you choose the different tools (e.g., Python vs R) is your choice. This is part of the assessment. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *At least* two different models (hypotheses) must be fitted to the data. The models should be fitted and selected using an appropriate method. Specifically, irrespective of the problem/dataset you choose (see below), use Nonlinear Least Squares (NLLS) to fit $\\ge 2$ alternative models to data, followed by model selection using AIC and BIC (read the Johnson and Omland 2005 paper). You may choose additional means for model comparison/selection beyond these.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The project should be fully reproducible. Write a script that \"glues\" the workflow together and runs it, from data processing to model fitting to plotting (e.g., in R) to compilation of the LaTeX written report (*More detailed instructions on report below*). Look back at the TheMulQuaBio to see how you would run the different components. For example, we have covered how to run R and compile $\\LaTeX$ using the `subprocess` module in Python. The assessor should be able to run just this script to get everything to work without errors. Use Python or to write this main script. If using bash, call it `run_MiniProject.sh` and if using Python, called it  `run_MiniProject.py`.\n",

    "* have an introduction with objectives of the study, and appropriate additional sections such as methods, data, results, discussion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* should contain in the *Methods* a sub-section called \"Computing tools\" which states briefly how each of the three scripting language (bash, R, Python) and what packages within them were used and a justification of why.\n",
    "\n",
    "* must contain $\\leq$3500 words *excluding the contents of the title page, references, and Figure or Table captions+legends*; there should be a word count at the beginning of the document (typically using the `texcount` package).\n",

    "# The Model Fitting Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pick from one of the following three options. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Thermal Performance Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "### The question \n",
    "\n",
    "*How well do different mathematical models, e.g., based upon biochemical (mechanistic) principles  vs. phenomenological ones, fit to the thermal responses of metabolic traits?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is currently a \"hot\" (no pun intended!) topic in biology. On the *ecological side*, because the temperature-dependence of metabolic rate sets the rate of intrinsic $r_\\text{max}$ (papers by Savage et al., Brown et al.) as well as interactions between species, it has a strong effect on population dynamics. In this context, note that 99.9% of life on earth is ectothermic! On the *evolutionary side*, the temperature-dependence of fitness and species interactions also means that warmer environments may have stronger rates of evolution. This may be compounded by the fact that mutation rates may also increase with temperature (papers by Gillooly et al.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called `ThermRespData.csv`. It contains a subset of the full \"BioTraits\" database. This subset contains hundreds of \"thermal responses\" for growth, respiration and photosynthesis rates in plants and bacteria (both aquatic and terrestrial). These data were collected through lab experiments across the world, and compiled by various people over the years. The field names are defined in a file called `BiotraitsTemplateDescription.pdf`, also in the `data` directory. The two main fields of interest are `OriginalTraitValue` (the trait values responding to temperature), and `ConTemp` (the temperature). Individual thermal response curves can be identified by `FinalID` values --- each `FinalID` corresponds to one thermal performance curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Models\n",
    "\n",
    "*All the following parameters and variables are in SI units*.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Another phenomenological model option is the [Briere model](Appendix-ModelFitting.ipynb#The-TPC-models):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B = B_0 T (T-T_0) \\sqrt{T_m-T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $T$ is temperature, $T_0$ and $T_m$ are the minimum and maximum feasible temperatures for the trait (below or above which the traits goes to zero), and $B_0$ is a normalization constant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the Schoolfield model (paper is in `readings` directory of TheMulQuaBio repo) is a mechanistic option that is based upon thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics:\n",

    "## Functional Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Question \n",
    "\n",
    "*How well do different mathematical models, e.g., based upon foraging theory (mechanistic) principles  vs. phenomenological ones, fit to functional responses data across species?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In ecological parlance, a functional response is the relationship between a consumer's (e.g., predator) biomass consumption rate and abundance of the target resource (e.g., prey). Functional responses arise from fundamental biological and physical constraints on consumer-resource interactions (e.g., Holling 1959, Pawar et al, 2012), and determine the rate of biomass flow between species in ecosystems across the full scale of sizes, from the smallest (e.g., microbes) to the largest (e.g., blue whales). Functional responses also play a key sole in determining the stability (responses to perturbations) of the food webs that underpin ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called `CRat.csv`. It contains measurements of rates of consumption of a single resource (e.g., prey, plants) species' by a consumer species (e.g., predators, grazers). These data were collected through lab and field experiments across the world. The field names are defined in a file called `BiotraitsTemplateDescription.pdf`, also in the `data` directory. The two main fields of interest are `OriginalTraitValue` (co trait values responding to), and `...` (the resource abundance). Individual functional response curves can be identified by `ID` values --- each `ID` corresponds to one curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Models\n",
    "\n",
    "*All the following parameters and variables are in SI units*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental measure of interest (the response variable) is consumption rate ($c$). This is expressed in terms of biomass quantity or number of individuals of resource consumed *per unit time per unit consumer* (so units of Mass (or Individuals) / Time). \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the simplest mathematical models you can use are the phenomenological quadratic and cubic polynomial models, that is eqns. \\ref{eq:quad} and \\ref{eq:cubic} (replace $x$ with resource abundance).\n",

    "### The Question \n",
    "\n",
    "*How well do different mathematical models, e.g., based upon population growth (mechanistic) theory  vs. phenomenological ones, fit to functional responses data across species?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Fluctuations in the abundance (density) of single populations may play a crucial role in ecosystem dynamics and emergent functional characteristics, such as rates of carbon fixation or disease transmission. A population grows exponentially while its abundance is low and resources are not limiting (the Malthusian principle). This growth then slows and eventually stops as resources become limiting. There may also be a time lag before the population growth really takes off at the start. We will focus on microbial (specifically, bacterial) growth rates. Bacterial growth in batch culture follows a distinct set of phases; lag phase, exponential phase and stationary phase. During the lag phase a suite of transcriptional machinery is activated, including genes involved in nutrient uptake and metabolic changes, as bacteria prepare for growth. During the exponential growth phase, bacteria divide at a constant rate, the population doubling with each generation. When the carrying capacity of the media is reached, growth slows and the number of cells in the culture stabilises, beginning the stationary phase. Traditionally, microbial growth rates were measured by plotting cell numbers or culture density against time on a semi-log graph and fitting a straight line through the exponential growth phase &ndash; the slope of the line gives the maximum growth rate ($r_{max}$). Models have since been developed which we can use to describe the whole sigmoidal bacterial growth curve. \n",

    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called `LogisticGrowthData.csv`. It contains measurements of change in biomass or number of cells of microbes over time. These data were collected through lab experiments across the world. The field names are defined in a file called  `LogisticGrowthMetaData.csv`, also in the `data` directory. The two main fields of interest are `PopBio` (abundance), and `Time`. Single population growth rate curves can be identified by as unique  temperature-species-medium-citation-replicate combinations (concatenate them to get a new string variable that identifies unique growth curves). \n",

    "Other popular models are the modified Gompertz model (Zwietering et. al., 1990), the Baranyi model (Baranyi, 1993), and the Buchanan model (or three-phase logistic model; Buchanan, 1997). The Buchanan model in particular is capable of capturing the lag phase before the population starts growing exponentially, often seen in microbial population growth. Examples of fitting these models are available in the [model fitting appendix](./Appendix-ModelFitting.ipynb#Population-growth-rate-example).   \n",

    "# Suggested Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build a workflow that starts with the data and ends with a report written in LaTeX. I suggest the following components and sequence in your workflow (you can choose to do it differently!):\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Python or R script that imports the data and prepares it for NLLS fitting, with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * It should create unique ids so that you can identify unique datasets (e.g., single thermal responses)\n",
    "    * It may filter out datasets with less than $x$ data points (where $x$ is the minimum number of data points needed to fit the models).\n",
    "    * It should deal with missing, and other problematic data values\n",
    "\n",
    "* The script should add columns containing starting values of the model parameters for the NLLS fitting (how will you get these?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save the modified data to a new csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script that opens the new modified dataset (from step 1) and does the NLLS fitting, with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses lmfit — look up submodules `minimize`, `Parameters`, `Parameter`, and `report_fit`. *Have a look through* <http://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py>, especially <http://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/fitting.html#minimize>\\\n",
    "You will have to install lmfit using pip or `easy_install` - use sudo mode. In addition to the lmfit example in class, you may want to look for others online.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Will use the try construct because not all runs will converge. Recall the try example from R\n",
    "\n",
    "* The more thermal response curves you are able to fit, the better — that is part of the challenge!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Will calculate AIC, BIC, R$^{2}$, and other statistical measures of fit (you decide what you want to include)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Will export the results to a csv that the plotting R script (next item) can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A R script that imports the results from the previous step and plots every thermal response with both models (or none, if nothing converges) overlaid — all plots should be saved in a single separate sub-directory. *Use ggplot for pretty results!*\n",
    "\n",
    "* LaTeX source code that generates your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Python script (saved in Code) called  run_MiniProject.py that runs the whole project, right down to compilation of the LaTeX  document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing all this may seem a bit scary at the start. However, you need to approach the problem systematically and methodically, and you will be OK. here are some suggested first steps to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore the data in R and get a preliminary version of the plotting script without the fitted models overlaid worked out. That will also give you a feel for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore the two models – be able to plot them. Write them as functions in your python script, because that's where you will use them (step 2 above) (you can use matplotlib for quick and dirty plotting and then suppress those code lines later).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Figure out, using a minimal example (say, with one, \"nice-looking\" thermal performance, functional response, or population growth  dataset) to see how the python `lmfit` module works. We can help you work out th minimal example, including the usage of try to catch errors in case the fitting doesn't converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "*One thing to note is that you may need to do the NLLS fitting on the logarithm of the function (and therefore, the data) to facilitate convergence.*"
