    "#### The Docstring\n",

    "Triple quotes start a “docstring” comment, which is meant to describe\n",
    "the operation of the script or a function/module within it. docstrings\n",
    "are considered part of the running code, while normal comments are\n",

    "reason (there’s always one!) for this. You might want to use a\n",
    "particular set of python <span>def</span>’s (functions) and statements\n",
    "either as a standalone function, or use it or subsets of it from other\n",
