    "A <span>*One-way analysis of variance*</span> (one-way ANOVA) is a\n",

    "\n",
    "ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that samples from two or more groups are\n",

    "this, ANOVA uses the <span>*F*</span>-statistic — the ratio of the\n",

    "the variance within the samples (groups). If the null hypothesis that\n",
    "the group means are drawn from populations with the same mean is indeed\n",
    "true, the between-group variance (numerator in the F-ratio) should be\n",
    "lower than the within-group variance (denominator). A higher ratio (and\n",
    "<span>*F*</span> value) therefore implies that the samples were drawn\n",

    "    $$\\text{ESS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2$$ ESS tells us\n",
    "    how much of the variation in the dependent variable our\n",
    "    alternative (linear) model was able to explain. That is, it’s the\n",
    "    reduction in uncertainty that occurs when the linear model is used\n",
    "    to predict the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual sum of squares (RSS)\n",

    ":   Sum of the squared differences between the observed $y$’s (denoted\n",

    "    $$\\text{RSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2$$ RSS tells us how\n",

    "### Degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus each sum of squares has a corresponding degrees of freedom (DF)\n",
    "associated with it that gives the Mean Sum of Squares (MSS) — the Sums\n",
    "of Squares divided by the corresponding degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TSS DF is one less than the number of observations $n-1$. This is\n",
    "because calculating TSS, needs $\\bar y$ , which imposes loss of one\n",
    "degree of freedom. Note that MSS is thus nothing but the sample\n",
    "variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ESS DF is one less than the number of coefficients ($n_c$)\n",
    "(estimated parameters) in the model: $n_c-1$. Note that in the case\n",
    "where the linear model is an ANOVA, it the number of coefficients equals\n",
    "the number of “treatments” (the categories or levels in the predictor).\n",
    "So for example, in Fig. \\[fig:anova1\\], there are three treatments\n",
    "(predictors) and therefore three coefficients ($\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$,\n",
    "$\\beta_3$), which means that the ESS degrees of freedom there is\n",
    "$n_c-1 = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RSS DF is the sample size $n$ minus the number of coefficients\n",
    "$n_c$, that is, $n - n_c$, because each estimated coefficient is an\n",
    "unknown parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The F-Value (or Ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, The F-Value or F-Ratio, the test statistic used to decide\n",
    "whether the linear model fit is statistically significant, is the ratio\n",
    "of the Mean ESS to the Mean RSS. The null hypothesis is rejected if the\n",
    "F-ratio is large — the model explains a significant amount of variance.\n",
    "The p-value is then calculated from the F-distribution as you learned\n",
    "before, in Chapter \\[ch:t\\_F\\_tests\\] (see Fig. \\[fig:fdist\\]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), also known as the\n",
    "standard error of the estimate, is the square root of the Mean RSS. It\n",
    "is the standard deviation of the data about the Linear model, rather\n",
    "than about the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The $R^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, $R^{2}$, also called the Coefficient of Determination, is the\n",
    "proportion of total error (TSS) explained by the model (ESS), so the\n",
    "ratio ESS/TSS. That is it is the proportion of the variability in the\n",
    "response that is explained by by the fitted model. Since TSS = ESS +\n",
    "RSS, $R^{2}$ can be rewritten as (TSS-RSS)/TSS = 1 - RSS/TSS. If a model\n",
    "has perfectly fits the data, $R^{2}=1$, and if it has no predictive\n",
    "capability $R^{2}=0$. In reality, $R^{2}$ will never be exactly 0\n",
    "because even a null model will explain some variance just by chance due\n",
    "to sampling error. Note that $R$, the square root of $R^2$, is the\n",
    "multiple correlation coefficient: the correlation between the observed\n",
    "values ($y$), and the predicted values ($\\hat{y}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "As additional predictors (end therefore linear model coefficients) are\n",
    "added to a linear model, $R^2$ increases even when the new predictors\n",
    "add no real predictive capability. The adjusted-$R^2$ tries to addresses\n",
    "this problem of over-specification or over-fitting by including the\n",
    "degrees of freedom: Adjusted $R^2$ = 1 - (RSS/$n-n_c-2$)/(TSS/$n-1$)\n",
    "[^2]. Thus additional predictors with little explanatory capability will\n",
    "increase the ESS (and reduce the RSS), but they will also have lower RSS\n",
    "degrees of freedom (because of the additional number of fitted\n",
    "coefficients, $n_c$’s)[^3]. Thus if the additional predictors have poor\n",
    "predictive capability, these two reductions will cancel each other out.\n",
    "In other words, the Adjusted $R^2$ penalizes the addition of new\n",
    "predictors to the linear model, so you should always have a look at the\n",
    "Adjusted $R^2$ as a corrected measure of $R^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new dataset\n",
    "-------------\n",

    "In this Chapter, we will use a new dataset of genome size and life\n",
