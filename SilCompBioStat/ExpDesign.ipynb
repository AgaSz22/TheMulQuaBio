    "    the individuals of the cod population is what we want to analyse.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Statistical) Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    ":   A statistical distribution is a mathematical description (expressed\n",
    "    as a mathematical equation) of the properties of a population\n",
    "    of interest. Theoreticians have come up with a bunch of\n",
    "    distributions (e.g., Gaussian or Normal, Poisson, Binomial, etc.)\n",
    "    that are appropriate for different kinds of data. Figuring out which\n",
    "    distribution best describes a population of interest is one of the\n",
    "    first steps in a statistical analysis. In reality, of course, even\n",
    "    collecting and measuring all the individuals of a population may not\n",
    "    be sufficient to characterize its statistical properties — imagine\n",
    "    the situation where the cod population has declined to a few hundred\n",
    "    individuals (not an impossibility in the future!).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Data or Population) Sample\n",
    "\n",
    ":   A data <span>*sample*</span> is a set of measurements of the\n",
    "    attribute of interest collected from a <span> *statistical\n",
    "    population*</span> by a defined procedure (<span>*sampling\n",
    "    methodology*</span>). In the cod example above, this would be the\n",
    "    weight of every individual of a <span>*subset*</span> of the\n",
    "    year-old Cod population.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Statistical) Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    ":   A statistical parameter is a measure of some attribute of the\n",
    "    <span>*theoretical*</span> statistical distribution that is support\n",
    "    to represent your population. An example would be the average weight\n",
    "    of yearling cod. In practice, this is not measurable because the\n",
    "    population is much too large or incompletely inaccessible/invisible\n",
    "    — imagine measuring the weight of every year-old cod individual in\n",
    "    the oceans!\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    ":   A statistic (singular) is an <span>*estimate*</span> of a\n",
    "    statistical parameter of the population of interest, obtained by\n",
    "    calculating the <span>*measure*</span> for a <span>*sample*</span>\n",
    "    (e.g., the average or mean weight of individuals in a sample of\n",
    "    one-year old cod). This is also your <span>*descriptive\n",
    "    statistic*</span>. Therefore, a <span>*Statistic*</span> is to a\n",
    "    <span>*Statistical Parameter*</span> what a <span> *Sample*</span>\n",
    "    is to the <span>*Statistical Population*</span>. For example, the\n",

    "    statistical parameter.\n",

    "Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    ":   A Hypothesis is an (hopefully) informed <span> *postulate*</span>\n",
    "    about an attribute of your population of interest. For example, you\n",
    "    may hypothesize that the one-year old cod population’s mean weight\n",
    "    has declined over the last two decades (it has!). You will want to\n",
    "    confront your main hypothesis with a “null” Hypothesis, to minimize\n",
    "    the risk of making a “type I” error. A type I error is the\n",
    "    probability of accepting an alternative (or main) hypothesis (and\n",
    "    rejecting the null hypothesis) that is not really valid (e.g., the\n",
    "    yearling cods have actually not declined in weight). This is a big\n",
    "    NO NO from a scientific and philosophical standpoint. The rate or\n",
    "    probability of the type I error is denoted by the Greek letter\n",
    "    $\\alpha$, and equals the <span>*significance level*</span> of a\n",
    "    statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental statistics that describe a sample (or a population) are,\n",
    "firstly, the mean, or average value of a sample, typically denoted by a\n",
    "$\\bar{x}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} =  \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i}{n} = \\frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + \\dots +x_{n}}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, it is the sum of all the values in a sample divided by the\n",
    "number, $n$, of items in the sample. Thus it is a measure of the <span>\n",
    "*central-tendency*</span> of the sample and population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the standard deviation ($s$) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s =  \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n (\\bar{x} - x_{i})^2}{n-1}} = \n",
    "    \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\bar{x} - x_{1})^{2} + (\\bar{x} - x_{2})^2 + \\dots + (\\bar{x} \n",
    "    - x_{n})^{2}}{n-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the the square root of the sum of squares (“SS”) of the\n",
    "differences between each item in the sample and the mean, divided by the\n",
    "<span>*degrees of freedom, “df”*</span> remaining in the data set ($ \n",
    "n-1$). df is the sample size, $n$, minus the number of statistical\n",
    "parameters estimated from the data set. This is to reduce the <span>\n",
    "*bias*</span> in your <span>*estimate*</span> of the statistic, as you\n",
    "are calculating it from the sample, and not the whole theoretical\n",
    "population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the formula for $s$ above has $n-1$ in its denominator because, to\n",
    "to work out the standard deviation, you must have already estimated the\n",
    "mean ($\\bar{x}$) from the same data set. This removes 1 degree of\n",
    "freedom. Also, note that the sample variance, $s^2$ is the square of\n",
    "standard deviation. Or, in other words, the standard deviation is the\n",
    "square-root of the variance!\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two statistics (mean and sd) are particularly meaningful when\n",
    "the sample and population have a symmetric distribution (e.g., normal or\n",
    "gaussian). When the distribution is not symmetric (that is, it is\n",
    "<span>*skewed*</span>), another statistic, the <span>*median*</span>\n",
    "becomes important. This is the middle value in the ordered set of data,\n",
    "that is exactly 50% of the data live below and 50% lie above the median.\n",
    "In skewed distributions, the median is a better measure of the\n",
    "<span>*central-tendency*</span> of the sample and population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other descriptive statistics you should keep in mind are the range\n",
