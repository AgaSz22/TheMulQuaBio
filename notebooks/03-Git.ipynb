Examples of binary files include compiled executables, zip files, images, word documents and videos. In contrast, text files are stored in a form (usually ASCII) that is human-readable by opening in a suitable text reader (e.g., geany, gedit). Without some git extensions and configurations (coming up next), binary files cannot be properly version-controlled because each version of the entire file is saved <span>*as is*</span> in a hidden\n",

Binary files are particularly problematic because each version of the file is saved <span>*as is*</span> in `.git`, when you have a large number of versions it means that there are the same number of binary files in the hidden directory (for example 100 $\\times$ &gt;100mb files!).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course at least, you should not try to keep large files (especially binary files under version control).
