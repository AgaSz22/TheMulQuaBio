\begin{aquote}{Donald Knuth}
It is hard for me to say confidently that, after fifty more years of explosive 
growth of computer science, there will still be a lot of fascinating unsolved 
problems at peoples' fingertips, that it won't be pretty much working on 
refinements of well-explored things. Maybe all of the simple stuff and the 
really great stuff has been discovered. It may not be true, but I can't predict 
an unending growth. I can't be as confident about computer science as I can 
about biology. Biology easily has 500 years of exciting problems to work on, 
it's at that level.

    \begin{itemize}
	    \item If using Mac OS, remember that not all commands behave the same between Mac OS and Linux 
		\end{itemize}
    
		\item Make sure you can access secured Imperial College wireless (use college name and password) --- external Bootcampers, use Eduroam or a guest account (ask me later) 
    \item Get an bitbucket or github account (read their Git tutorials (quite intuitive)) --- free private repos using your college email account

degree of mastery of it!
    \item Return it to Martin Selby at end of Course (CMEE Masters) or Bootcamp/Winter term (QMEE CDT)
    \item We expect it to be undamaged

residence!) overnight, starting now

      \item 2 1-hr lectures in the morning (1000 -- 1230, except in come cases)
      \item 3-hour practical in afternoon, except on Wednesdays
      \item Lecturers will stay for at least 1 hour of practical session
      \item There may be deviations from this -- check updated timetables (use ical)!
      \item Demonstrators will be available during practicals in botcamp and most other weeks

	 \item You are encouraged to give talks for feedback / discussion at 
	 other times of the week, especially in the Spring --- great for 
	 running ideas past peers (you can give multiple short ones)
