All code in this project was written in and tested with R 3.xx and Python 3.xx, though older language versions (including R 2.xx and Python 2.7) should work in most cases.

See [Index.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb) for a table of contents of the chapters (all jupyter notebooks).

## For Contributors/Co-authors:

* Note that the old materials, written in LaTeX, are now in the `archived` directory.
* The solutions to the exercises are in a separate, [private git repo](https://bitbucket.org/mhasoba/themulquabio_sols) that students do not have access to. Ask Samraat (mhasoba@gmail.com) if you need access to that repository.
  * Students will be given access to solutions when the time comes through the directory `sols`.
* The `results` directory will be populated only when scripts are run, but these are not version controlled (all files in this directory under `.gitignore`).
