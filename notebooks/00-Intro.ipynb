Maybe all of the simple stuff and the really great stuff has been discovered. It may not be true, but I can't predict an unending growth. I can't be as confident about computer science as I can about biology. Biology easily has 500 years of exciting problems to work on, it's at that level.*\n",

    "These online notes have emerged from the development of content for modules on Biological Computing taught in various past and present courses at the Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London. These courses include Year 1 & 2 Computational Biostatistics modules at the South Kensington Campus, the Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) Masters program at the Silwood Park campus, the Quantitative Methods in Ecology and Evolution Centre for Doctoral Training (QMEE CDT), and the training workshops of the VectorBiTE RCN.\n",

    "Different subsets of this document will be covered in different courses. Please look up your respective course guidebooks/handbooks to determine when the modules covered in these notes are scheduled in your course. You will be given instructions about which sections are covered in your course.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the chapters of these notes are written as [jupyter]((https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/blob/master/notebooks/Intro.ipynb) notebooks. each chapter/notebook is accompanied by data and code on which you can practice your skills in your own time and during practical sessions.  These materials are available (and will be updated regularly) at a [git repository](\n",

We use git for hosting this course's materials because we want to version-control this course's content, which is constantly evolving to keep up with changing programming/computing technologies. That is, we are treating this course as any computing project that needs to be regularly updated and improved. Changes to the notes and content will also be made based upon student feedback.

In programming and computing, you learn faster by trying to solve problems (including computer crashes!) on your own, often by liberally googling the problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this book is to teach you to become (or at least show you the path towards becoming) a competent quantitative biologist. A large part of this involves learning computer programming. Why do biologists\n",
    "need to write write computer programs? Here are some (hopefully compelling!) reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Short of fieldwork, programs can do anything (that can be specified). In fact, even fieldwork, if you could one day *program* a robot to do it for you <sup>[1](#intro:robot)</sup>!\n",
    "\n",
    "* As such, no software is typically available to perform exactly the analysis you are planning. You should be unhappy if you are trying to shoehorn your data into methods that don't quite seem right.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Biological problems and datasets are some of the most complicated imaginable. Programming permits success despite\n",
    "complexity through precise specification and modularization of complicated analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modularity – programming allows you to break up your complex analysis in smaller pieces, yet keep all the pieces in a single, functional analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reproducibility – you (or someone else) can just re-run the code to reproduce your analysis. This is also the key to maintaining scientific accountability, integrity, and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Organised thinking – writing code requires you to do this!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Career prospects – good, scientific coders are in short supply in all fields, but most definitely in biology!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several hundred programming languages currently available – which ones should a biologist choose? Ideally, a quantitative biologist would multilingual, knowing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A *fast*, compiled (or semi-compiled) 'procedural' language like `C`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A modern, easy-to-write, interpreted (or semi-compiled) language that is still quite fast, like `python`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A mathematical/statistical software with programming and graphing capabilities like `R`\n",
    "\n",
    "And all these because one language doesn't fit all purposes. Therefore you will learn a few different languages in this course — hopefully, just the right number! Among the languages you will learn here — ` python`, `R`, and `C` are three of the [most popular currently](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index) (also [see](https://goo.gl/vyrqr1), and with good reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to teach you not just programming, but also good computing practices. In this course, you will write plenty of code, deal with different data files, and produce text and graphic outputs. You will learn to keep your project and coursework organized in logical, efficient, error-free and reproducible *workflows* (that's a mouthful, but an important mouthful).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some guidelines, conventions and rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beware the dark forces\n",
    "\n",
    "You will NOT be using spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel) in these lasses. There are times when you will feel the pull of the dark side (ahem!), and imagine a more \"comfortable\" world where you are mouse-clicking your way happily though Excel-based data manipulations and analyses. NO! You will be doing yourself a disservice. On the\n",
    "long-ish run you will be much better off visualizing and manipulating data on your computer using a programming language like R. This is something you will learn, young [*padawan*](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padawan)!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep your workflow organized\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following chapters, you will practice many examples where you are required to write large blocks of code. Please get into the habit of writing code into text files with an appropriate extension (e.g., `.R` for `R` code, `.py` for `python` code, etc.). Furthermore, please keep all your code files organized in one or more directories (e.g., named `Code`!). Similarly, some of these scripts will take data files as inputs, and output some results in the form of text or graphics. Please keep these inputs and outputs organized as well, in\n",
    "separate directories (e.g., named `Data` and ` Results`) respectively. Your instructor(s) will help you get set up and abide by this \"workflow\".\n",

    "Throughout these sessions, directory paths will be specified in UNIX (Mac, Linux) style, using `/` instead of the `\\` used in Windows. Also, in general, we will be using [relative paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)) throughout the exercises and practicals (more on this later, but google it!).\n",

    "* Your typical *modus operandi* should be to google the main keywords along the programming language name (e.g.,  \"unix mv vs cp\"). \n",
    "* Look for [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [stackexchange](https://stackexchange.com/) based results in particular. Look for number of endorsements for both the question that has been asked, and for its answer.\n",
    "* Be selective - there will often be multiple solutions to the same issue or problem - donlt just blindly use the first one you find. \n",
    "* Also, every time a mysterious, geeky-sounding term like \"relative path\" or \"version control\" appears, please google it as well!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### To IDE or not to IDE?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you embark on your journey to becoming a competent prectioner of biological computing, you will be faced with a hamletian question: \"To IDE or not to IDE\" (anagram alert!). OK, maybe not that dramatic or hamletian...\n",
    "\n",
    "An interactive Development Environment (IDE) is a text editor with frills that can make life easy by auto-formatting code, running code though the terminal or command line, allowing a graphic view of the workspace (your active functions, variables, etc.), graphic debugging and profiling (you will see these delightful things later), and allowing integrated version control (e.g., using `git`). You will benefit a lot of you use a code editor that can also offer an IDE (e.g., emacs, vim, geany, atom). At the very least, your IDE should offer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Auto-indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatic code wrapping (e.g., keeping lines $<$80 characters long)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Syntax highlighting (e.g., commands vs. variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code folding (fold large blocks of code, say an entire function or loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keyboard control of commenting/uncommenting, code wrapping, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Embedded terminal / shell / commandline console\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sending commands to terminal / shell\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you end up using multiple programming languages, you will want an IDE that can handle them. For example, `RStudio` cannot handle more than a fixed set of 2-3 languages. I use `vscode`,which has many plugins that make multi-language (multilingual?) code development much easier. Other good options are `atom`, `vim` or `emacs`. The last two have a steeper learning curve, but are very powerful once you have mastered them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Undergraduates\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessment will be through a computer-based test. You be expected to be able to apply the concepts you have learned to address questions by using appropriate R input and interpreting R output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Masters students\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assess both your practical computing work itself (including any writeups), and whether you are following good programming and workflow practices, on a weekly basis. This will be done using scripts — yes we\n",
    "will assess your scripts using scripts! A `python` script will check whether your weekly (and version-controlled) directories are neat and organized in a logical workflow, and whether all the scripts run correctly with the expected inputs and outputs, starting from Week 1 ([UNIX Chapter](chap:unix1)). Specifically, as an example towards learning good workflow practices, you will keep all your coursework code, data inputs and results outputs organized in separate directories named `code`, `data`, `results` (or equivalent) respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment script will then record a log file that summarizes all the issues found in your workflows, which will be emailed to you by the middle of the week (usually on the wednesday) subsequent to the one you\n",
    "submitted your weekly practical work in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that practicals in the weeks not included in this book (e.g., GIS, Genomics, Population Genetics) will also be included in the assessment, so keep the workflow in those weeks organized, even if the analyses or pipelines/workflows you were taught we not fully reusable or machine-reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rules you must follow, irrespective of a Week's content are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  All code/scripts go to a `Code` directory\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  All data go to a `Data` directory\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  All results go to a `Results` directory, but the Results directory should be empty when you submit your week's work, as it will be populated automatically when the assessment script runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  If you have files that don't fit in these categories, put them additional, meaningfully named directories (e.g, \"Writeup\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  No single file should be greater than 100 mb, either data or script/code. If a script needs a data file, but the example data file is &gt;100 mb, reduce it to a minimum working dataset and upload that, keeping the main data file(s) under `.gitignore` (see the [Git Chapter]). Keep the main data backed up of course <sup>[1](#intro:testdata)</sup>!.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Most importantly, all python, R, bash, and $\\LaTeX$ scripts should run without errors, taking in data and spitting out the results as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "When necessary, more specific, module-specific details on weekly coursework and assessment will be given when the module starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computing coursework marking criteria are given in the [Appendix](#chap:Appendices).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Weekly practicals wrap-up\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this at the end of every week:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Review and make sure you can run all the commands, code fragments, and named scripts we have built till now and get the expected outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Review your code files and annotate/comment code lines as much and as often as necessary using `#`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Keep all code, data and results files organized in you weekly directory\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The final assessment of weekly coursework\n",
    "\n",
    "A written summary assessment of your overall performance with your marks will be sent after the end of the 9 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly assessments are to help you spot general, as well as programming language-specific issues with your computing coursework on a regular basis. You may and should fix bugs and other problems that feedback logs bring to your attention. We will have a look at how much you addressed the issues in the final assessment. The final assessment will be necessarily a more subjective than the weekly assessments as we are looking to give you an overall picture of how you did and what you can improve on. To give you an idea about the criteria for the overall\n",
    "assessment, a set of summative marking criteria are also given in [the Appendix](#chap:Appendices (titled *MARKING CRITERIA for EXAMS and ESSAYS and COURSEWORK*).\n",
