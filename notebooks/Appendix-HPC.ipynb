    "* [Ipython `parallel`](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/parallel)\n",

    "\n",
    "The difference between threading and multiprocessing is that threads share the same memory allocation, while processes have separate memory allocations. This makes it a harder to share information between processes with multiprocessing, but this is till a useful approach for quick and dirty parallelization. When better communication between processes is required, sophisticated solutions such as MPI and OpenMP may be needed. The MPI (Message Passing Interface) standard/protocol can be used in Python to parallelize your code over multiple processors through the [`mpi4py` package]\n",
    "(http://mpi4py.scipy.org/docs/usrman/index.html). You can also parallelize numpy array loops with [`cython` and OpenMP](http://www.perrygeo.com/parallelizing-numpy-array-loops-with-cython-and-mpi.html).\n",
