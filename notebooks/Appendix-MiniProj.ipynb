    "We have talked a lot about workflows and confronting models with data. It's time to do something concrete with all the techniques you have learnt!\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMEE Miniproject gives you an opportunity to try the \"whole nine yards\" of developing and implementing a workflow and delivering a \"finished product\" — where you ask and answer a scientific question in biology (potentially involving multiple sub-questions/hypotheses). It will give you an opportunity to perform a \"dry run\" of executing your actual dissertation project, and you may use it to trial some of the techniques and/or explore some of the data/theory you might use in your Dissertation project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**The general question you will address is:** *What mathematical model best fits an empirical dataset?*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think of this as testing a set of alternative hypotheses — every alternative hypothesis is nothing but an alternative model to describe an observed phenomenon (more on this in the Primer on Model Fitting Lectures delivered during the Miniproject week).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Project \n",
    "\n",
    "You may choose any dataset and set of alternative models, provided that the work can feasibly be done in the time you have for your miniproject (see the CMEE Guidebook for the submission deadline). You may choose a problem and dataset that is a related to, or even preliminary work for your main Masters project (to give you a reality/feasibility) check.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please read the papers in the Readings & Resources section of this chapter* — these will help you make a decision about what data and what models to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also be give lectures on model fitting in Ecology ad Evolution at the start of the Miniproject week.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Miniproject must satisfy the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It should employ all the biological computing tools you have learned so far: shell (bash) scripting, git, LaTeX, R, and Python. Using these tools, you will build a workflow that starts with the data and ends with a written report (in LaTeX).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *At least* two different models (hypotheses) must be fitted to the data. The models should be fitted and selected using an appropriate method (e.g., non-linear least squares for model fitting and the Akaike Information Criterion for model selection, respectively). You will be given a primer on model fitting before you start on your Miniproject.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The project should be fully reproducible — a script should glue the workflow together and run it. I should be able to run just this script to get everything to work, from data processing to model fitting to plotting (e.g., in R) to compilation of the LaTeX written report. (*More detailed instructions on this below*).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unable to find a dataset and/or problem that you would like to tackle, you may use the \"TPC problem\" given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patching together your computing workflow components\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Python and/or bash scripting for this. If using bash, call it  run_MiniProject.sh and if using Python, called it  run_MiniProject.py. It should run all the components of the project's workflow, including compilation of the LaTeXdocument. Look back at the notes to see how you would run these different components.\n",
    "For example, we have covered how to run R and compile $\\LaTeX$ using  subprocess in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Report\n",
    "\n",
    "The report should,\n",
    "\n",
    "* be written in LaTeX  using the article document class, in 11pt (any font will do, within reason!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* be double-spaced, with *continuous* line numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "* have a title, author name with affiliation and wordcount (next point) on a separate title page.\n",
    "\n",
    "* have an introduction with objectives of the study, and appropriate additional sections such as methods, data, results, discussion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* should contain in the Methods a sub-section called \"Computing languages\" which states briefly how each of the three scripting language (bash, R, Python) was used, and a justification of why.\n",
    "\n",
    "* must contain $\\leq$3500 words *excluding the contents of the title page, references, and Figure or Table captions+legends*; there should be a word count at the beginning of the document (typically using the `texcount` package).\n",
    "\n",
    "* have references properly cited in text and formatted in a list using bibtex.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the writeup, you probably should read the *general* (*not* word count, formatting etc.) dissertation writing\n",
    "guidelines given in the Silwood Masters Student Guidebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Commit and push all your work to your bitbucket repository using a directory called `MiniProject` at the same level as the Week1, Week2 etc. directories, by the Miniproject deadline given in your course guidebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we am not going to tell you how to organize your project — that's part of the marking criteria (see next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equal weightage will be given to the code+workflow and writeup components — each component will be marked to a max of 100 pts and then rescaled to a single mark / 100 using equal weightage*\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be looking for the following while assessing your submission:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A well-organized project where code, results, data, etc., are easy to locate, inspect, and use. In the project's README also include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Any dependencies or special packages the user/marker should be aware of\n",
    "\n",
    "    * What each package you used is for\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Version of each language used\n",
    "\n",
    "* A python or bash script called run_MiniProject.py or un_MiniProject.sh respectively, that runs the project\n",
    "\n",
    "* A report that contains all the components indicated above in \"The Report\" subsection — we will be looking for some original thought and synthesis in the Intro and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quality of the presentation of the graphics and tables in your report, as well as any plots showing model fits to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The marking criteria you may refer to is the [summative marking criteria]((./MARKING_CRITERIA.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Candidate Problem: Fitting TPCs\n",
    "\n",
    "One choice you have is to use a large dataset that we can provide to address the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "*How well do different mathematical models, based upon biochemical principles vs. phenomenological ones, fit to the thermal responses of metabolic traits (rates)?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is currently a \"hot\" (no pun intended!) topic in biology, with both ecological and evolutionary consequences, as we discussed in the modelling lecture. On the *ecological side*, because the temperature-dependence of metabolic rate sets the rate of intrinsic $r_\\text{max}$ (papers by Savage et al., Brown et al.) as well as interactions between species, it has a strong effect on population dynamics. In this context, note that 99.9% of life on earth is\n",
    "ectothermic! On the *evolutionary side*, the temperature-dependence of fitness and species interactions also means\n",
    "that warmer environments may have stronger rates of evolution. This may be compounded by the fact that mutation rates may also increase with temperature (papers by Gillooly et al.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called BiotraiTPCdata.csv and contains hundreds of \"thermal responses\" for growth, respiration and\n",
    "photosynthesis rates in plants and bacteria (both aquatic and terrestrial). These data were collected through lab experiments across the world, and compiled by various people over the years. A subset of this BioTraits database used as an example in the Databases section of the [second Python Chapter]().\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Models\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple models that might best describe these data. The Schoolfield model (paper is in Readings directory) is one mechanistic option that is based upon thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\label{eq:schoolf}\n",

    "### The Workflow\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* A Python or R script that imports the data and prepares it for NLLS fitting, with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * It should create unique ids so that you can identify unique thermal responses (what does this mean?)\n",
    "    * It should filter out datasets with less than 5 data points (why?)\n",
    "    * It should deal with negative and zero trait values (why?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The script should add columns containing starting values of the model parameters for the NLLS fitting (how will you get these?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save the modified data to a new csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script that opens the new modified dataset (from step 1) and does the NLLS fitting, with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses lmfit — look up submodules `minimize`, `Parameters`, `Parameter`, and `report_fit`. *Have a look through* <http://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py>, especially <http://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/fitting.html#minimize>\\\n",
    "You will have to install lmfit using pip or `easy_install` - use sudo mode. In addition to the lmfit example in class, you may want to look for others online.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Will use the try construct because not all runs will converge. Recall the try example from R\n",
    "\n",
    "* The more thermal response curves you are able to fit, the better — that is part of the challenge!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Will calculate AIC, BIC, R$^{2}$, and other statistical measures of fit (you decide what you want to include)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Will export the results to a csv that the plotting R script (next item) can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A R script that imports the results from the previous step and plots every thermal response with both models (or none, if nothing converges) overlaid — all plots should be saved in a single separate sub-directory. *Use ggplot for pretty results!*\n",
    "\n",
    "* LaTeX source code that generates your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Python script (saved in Code) called  run_MiniProject.py that runs the whole project, right down to compilation of the LaTeX  document.\n",

    "* Explore the data in R and get a preliminary version of the plottingscript without the fitted models overlaid worked out. That will also give you a feel for the data.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Figure out, using a minimal example (say, with one, \"nice-looking\" thermal response dataset) to see how the python `lmfit` module works. We can help you work out th minimal example, including the usage of try to catch errors in case the fitting doesn't converge.\n",
